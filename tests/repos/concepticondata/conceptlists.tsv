Wang-2004-471	Wang, Feng	2004		471	questionnaire,basic	English,Chinese	Bai dialects (Tibeto-Burman)		Wang2004b		This concept list was used for a study on Bai dialects, based on original field work by the author. The thesis was published officially two years later ([Wang 2006](:bib:Wang2006)), potentially with small modifications. The seemingly inconsistent numbering of concepts indicates a probably larger questionnaire underlying the data which was published in the end. In some cases, English glosses were missing or not complete. We have added them and indicated this by putting them in square brackets.
